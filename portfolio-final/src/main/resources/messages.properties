clientBillingDescription=Developed a website and automated invoicing platform for an accounting consulting firm serving small and medium-sized businesses with support in English and French. Contributed to frontend and backend development, created and managed customer profiles, tracked hourly rate projects/services, generated and stored invoices in PDF format and sent automated email notifications allowing clients to view and download invoices
petClinicDescription=This project involved extending the functionality of the Spring Boot Microservices Pet Clinic application to streamline veterinary clinic operations. My primary contribution was to the Vet Service, where I developed features to manage veterinarian profiles, ratings, and specialties. I implemented APIs to handle operations such as viewing, updating, and retrieving veterinarian-related data. Additional responsibilities included integrating the vet service with other microservices in the system, ensuring smooth data flow. Working in a Scrum-based team, I practiced TDD, contributed to frontend components in React, and implemented CI/CD pipelines for consistent delivery. This project provided hands-on experience in microservices architecture, collaboration, and Agile methodologies.
sneakerEcommerceWSDescription=This microservices-based sneaker e-commerce platform was focused exclusively on backend development, leveraging Spring Boot to implement services for managing sneakers, customers, inventory, and purchases. Each service exposes RESTful APIs for CRUD operations and integrates with its own database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB). The project also features an API Gateway for routing and Dockerized deployment for scalability and maintainability. This backend-only implementation strengthened my skills in microservices architecture, database integration, and REST API design.
sneakerEcommerceDescription= This Sneaker E-commerce platform was developed to provide users with an engaging online shopping experience for sneakers. My primary focus was on building the backend services using Spring Boot, including REST APIs for managing sneaker and brand data. On the frontend, I implemented dynamic catalog browsing and brand navigation features using React. One of the key challenges was optimizing database queries for efficient data retrieval, which improved page load times for the sneaker catalog. Additionally, implementing seamless navigation between sneaker and brand pages enhanced the user experience. This project solidified my understanding of full-stack development, API design, and CRUD operations.
shootingGameDescription=This 2D Shooting Game project was developed using Unity and C#. It focuses on creating an engaging gameplay experience with dynamic backgrounds, customizable weapons, and interactive targets. I worked on implementing smooth gun rotation using mouse controls, designing sound effects for shooting actions, and developing a high-score system. A key challenge was integrating different target movement patterns, which improved my skills in game physics and logic programming.
resumeBuilderDescription=This Resume Builder Application was designed to help users create professional resumes effortlessly. Leveraging C# and WPF, I implemented an intuitive interface where users can input their education, work experience, hobbies, and references. A key challenge was building a feature to format resumes dynamically according to predefined templates, which deepened my understanding of UI design and data binding in WPF. Additionally, integrating a PDF export functionality enhanced my skills in working with third-party libraries.
